The project focuses on the development of Indian agriculture system and crop 
Cultivation management system. The cropple collect data from soil such as 
Content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It than manipulate
The datas obtained from real time and send it to aws server.
In turn aws server data is fetched by our developed android application 
Which is wirelessly Connected to cropple . Our application 
Shows all the necessary details about soil testing. App is AI powered
It can predict suitable crops which is best to cultivate in that condition 
Moreover it contains details about different type of crop that can be 
Cultivated across India. 
The most amazing thing about the app is that it uses the phone camera 
To predict the disease of the plant and infact it guides the farmer with some
Necessary steps to handle it.
